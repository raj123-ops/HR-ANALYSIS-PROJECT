# HR-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
HR ANALYSIS PROJECT
🧹 Data Preprocessing & Modeling (Python)

This project involves preprocessing HR employee data and building a predictive model to identify employee attrition. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

🔄 Data Cleaning

Handled missing values by removing or imputing them.

Removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

Performed standardization and normalization where required.


🧠 Model Training

Trained a classification model to predict employee attrition.

Evaluated the model using F1-score to account for class imbalance.


🧪 Model Improvement

Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.

Re-trained and validated the model, achieving improved F1-score performance.

📊 Power BI Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard provides a visual representation of employee attrition insights derived from the processed HR dataset.

📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Total Employees: 1470

Attrition Count: 237

Attrition Rate: 16%

Average Age: 37 years

Average Salary: 7K

Average Years at Company: 7

Gender Distribution (Attrition):

Male: 882

Female: 588
📈 Key Insights from Dashboard

🎓 Attrition by Education:

Life Sciences: 41%

Medical: 32%

Marketing: 11%

Technical Degree: 9%

Other: 6%


This suggests that employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds are leaving more frequently — potentially due to lower compensation or higher workload compared to industry norms.

👥 Attrition by Age Slab:

26–35 years: 606 employees

36–45 years: 468 employees

46–55 years: 226 employees

18–25 years: 123 employees

55+ years: 47 employees


A major portion of attrition lies in the 26–45 age group, likely because this age bracket is more career-driven, exploring better opportunities or experiencing slower growth and low salary progression in the current organization.

🧪 Attrition by Job Role:

The matrix shows that Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists have the highest frequency of low satisfaction ratings (1 star) — this points to deeper dissatisfaction within these roles and may be driving up attrition.
💰 Attrition by Salary Slab:

Up to 5K: 749 employees

5K to 10K: 440 employees

10K to 15K: 148 employees

15K+: 133 employees


A clear downward trend in attrition is seen as salary increases. The highest attrition is among employees earning below 5K, which likely indicates dissatisfaction due to low compensation. This suggests that salary is a strong influencing factor in employee retention.

🧑‍💼 Attrition by Job Role:

Sales Executive: 326

Research Scientist: 292

Manufacturing Director: 145

Sales Representative: 83

Research Director: 80


The Sales Executive and Research Scientist roles have the highest attrition, pointing to potential issues like job pressure, unclear KPIs, or growth limitations. These roles may require deeper analysis to identify workplace stressors or skill mismatches.

📈 Attrition by Years at Company:

From the area chart, attrition peaks during the 3rd and 7th years of tenure.

The 3rd year spike may indicate disillusionment after initial onboarding and training phases.

The 7th year spike could reflect employees reaching a career stagnation point, prompting them to seek external opportunities for advancement.
